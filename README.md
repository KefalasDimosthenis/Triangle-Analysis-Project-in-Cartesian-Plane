# Triangle Analysis Project in Cartesian Plane

This project was created by NIKOLAOS-DIMOSTHENIS KEFALAS.

## Description

This project analyzes triangles in a Cartesian plane with x and y axes ranging from -100 to 100. It generates 100 points with integer coordinates within the limits of the axes. For all possible triangles formed with vertices from any three of the selected points, the calculation of their areas is requested. Additionally, statistical analysis of the areas is required, specifically calculating the mean, median, and standard deviation.
